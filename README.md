# The-Old-German-dictionary
En: A Dictionary That Hasn't Kept Up with the Times / de: Ein W√∂rterbuch, das mit der Zeit nicht Schritt gehalten hat

üç∫ While studying German, instead of focusing on the actual German learning, I came up with an idea related to it and ended up starting development..

## What is this? üç∫
### Features

- The system searches the database for the input word.
- If the word is found, the German translation, gender (for nouns), and verb forms (for verbs) are displayed.
- If the word is not found in the database, it shows a message saying the word is not found.

#### 4. Initialize Database
